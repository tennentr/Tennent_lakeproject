# Tennent_lakeproject

The code I've provided here is from my current project on lake sediment. I include code I used to merge two dataframes 
(an existing dataframe containing all of relevant datasets for the project, 
and a new dataframe containing an updated age model), some code I use to plot data 
(I only included XRF elemental count data here, for simplicities sake), and the code I use to run Principal Component Analysis. The first part of this code
groups data into K-clusters, and the later part runs the PCA and applies to K-clusters the PCA plots.
